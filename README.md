This project represents an app that uses a toy example of a social network stored as a graph database which illustrates the power of Neo4jâ€™s graph algorithms and graph data science tools

## Input:

## Output:

- Display the graph in browser
- PageRank score for requested person node to reflect that person's popularity
- Shorthest path between two people to show how they are related within the social network
- Likelyhood of relationship between two people being established based on link prediction algorithm
